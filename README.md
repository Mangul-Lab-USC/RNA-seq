## ðŸ“Š Datasets

We compiled publications describing novel RNA-seq tools from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com).  
Our approach for extracting and verifying software links is described in the **Methods** section of the manuscript. Timeout links were manually verified.

The dataset is provided as a CSV file and contains the following fields:
- Name of the tool  
- Year of publication  
- Software interface utilized  
- Package manager availability  
- Docker containerization support  
- Multithreading capacity  
- User guide availability  
- Sample dataset availability  
- Archival stability  
- Number of releases or updates  
- Benchmarking practices  
- License type  
- Citation count
